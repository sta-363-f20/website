### Update the author with your name

### Modify the following plot to change the color of all points to `"pink"`.

```{r starwars-plot}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, size = birth_year)) +
  geom_point(color = "#30509C")
```

### Modify the following code to create a boxplot of height grouped by gender

After editing the code, change the chunk option to `eval = TRUE`.

```{r starwars-boxplot, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars,
       mapping = aes(x = gender, y = height)) +
  geom_---()
```

### Stretch goal: Add labels for title, x and y axes, and size of points.
