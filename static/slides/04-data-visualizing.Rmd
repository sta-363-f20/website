# Exploratory data analysis

---

## What is EDA?

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize its main characteristics.
- Often, this is visual. That's what we're focusing on today.
- But we might also calculate summary statistics and perform data wrangling/manipulation/transformation at (or before) this stage of the 
analysis. That's what we'll focus on next.

## Data visualization

> *"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind than any other device." — John Tukey*

- Data visualization is the creation and study of the visual representation of data.
- There are many tools for visualizing data (R is one of them), and many approaches/systems within R for making data visualizations (**ggplot2** is one of them, and that's what we're going to use).

- **ggplot2** is tidyverse's data visualization package
- The `gg` in "ggplot2" stands for Grammar of Graphics
- It is inspired by the book **Grammar of Graphics** by Leland Wilkinson <sup>†</sup>

What does each row represent? What does each column represent?
]

```{r, eval = FALSE}
starwars
```

.small[

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
starwars %>%

- Each row is an **observation**

## What's that warning?

- Not all characters have height and mass information (hence 28 of them not plotted)

.small[
```
## Warning: Removed 28 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

- Going forward I'll suppress the warning to save room on slides, but it's important to note it

## Additional variables

We can map additional variables to various features of the plot:

- aesthetics
  - color
  - size
  - shape
  - alpha (transparency)
- faceting: small multiples displaying different subsets

# Aesthetics

---
class: left

## Aesthetics options

Visual characteristics of plotting characters that can be **mapped to a specific variable**
in the data are

- `color`
- `size`
- `shape`
- `alpha` (transparency)

## Mass vs. height + gender

.small[
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height=3.5, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point()
```
]
---
class: left

## Mass vs. height + gender

Let's map the size to birth_year:

.small[
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars,
       mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender, 
                     size = birth_year #<<
       )) +
  geom_point()
```
]

---
class: left

## Mass vs. height + gender

Let's now increase the size of all points **not** based on the values of a 
variable in the data:

.small[
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height=3.5, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) #<<
```
]

---
class: left

## Aesthetics summary

- Continuous variable are measured on a continuous scale
- Discrete variables are measured (or often counted) on a discrete scale

aesthetics    | discrete                 | continuous
------------- | ------------------------ | ------------
color         | rainbow of colors        | gradient
size          | discrete steps           | linear mapping between radius and value
shape         | different shape for each | shouldn't (and doesn't) work

- Use aesthetics for mapping features of a plot to a variable, define the features in the geom for customization **not** mapped to a variable

class: center, middle

# Faceting

---
class: left

## Faceting options

- Smaller plots that display different subsets of the data
- Useful for exploring conditional relationships and large data

.small[
```{r fig.height=2, fig.width=6, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ gender) + #<<
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       subtitle = "Faceted by gender",  #<<
       x = "Height (cm)", y = "Weight (kg)")
```

## Facet summary

- `facet_grid()`: 
- 2d grid
- `rows ~ cols`
- use `.` for no split

# Identifying variables

---

## Types of variables

- **Numerical variables** (quantitative variables) can be classified as **continuous** or **discrete** based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively. 
- If the variable is **categorical**, we can determine if it is **ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering.
