## `r emo::ji("v")` types of statistical learning

.large[
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
]

## Supervised Learning

.my-footer[.small[Dr. Lucy D'Agostino McGowan _adapted from slides by Hastie & Tibshirani_
]]

* **outcome variable**: $Y$, (dependent variable,
response, target)
--

* **predictors**: vector of $p$ predictors, $X$, (inputs,
regressors, covariates, features, independent variables)
--

* In the **regression problem**, $Y$ is quantitative (e.g price,
blood pressure)
--

* In the **classification** problem, $Y$ takes values in a finite,
unordered set (survived/died, digit 0-9, cancer class of
tissue sample)
--

* We have **training data** $(x_1, y_1), \dots, (x_N, y_N)$. These are
observations (examples, instances) of these measurements

---

## Supervised Learning

.question[
What do you think are some objectives here?
]

--

### Objectives

* Accurately predict unseen test cases
* Understand which inputs affect the outcome, and how
* Assess the quality of our predictions and inferences

]]

## Unsupervised Learning

.my-footer[.small[Dr. Lucy D'Agostino McGowan _adapted from slides by Hastie & Tibshirani_
]]

* No outcome variable, just a set of predictors (features)
measured on a set of samples
--

* objective is more fuzzy -- find groups of samples that
behave similarly, find features that behave similarly, find
linear combinations of features with the most variation
--

* difficult to know how well your are doing
--

* different from supervised learning, but can be useful as a
pre-processing step for supervised learning

# Let's go!

## Log in to RStudio Pro

- **Note:** if you are off campus, you will need to use a [VPN to connect](https://is.wfu.edu/services/vpn/)
- Go to [rstudio.hpc.ar53.wfu.edu:8787](rstudio.hpc.ar53.wfu.edu:8787)
- Your username is your WFU username (typically the first part of your email)
- The password is: **R2D2Star!**

---

## <i class="fas fa-laptop"></i> Create a classification model

- Once you log on to RStudio Pro, click on this course's workspace "STA 363 - S20" then click "Projects"
- You should see a project called `zipcode`, click it.
- In the Files pane in the bottom right corner, spot the file called `zipcode.Rmd`. Open it, and then click on the "Knit" button. *You will likely see an pop-up error, click "Try Again"*
- Go back to the file and change your name on top (in the `yaml` -- we'll talk about what this means later) and knit again.
- Then, scroll to the `recipe` chunk, below **First we create a recipe**. Instead of creating a model to classify whether the number is **0** or not, create a model to predict whether the number is **1**. Knit again & voila!

Once done, place a green sticky on your laptop. If you have questions, place a pink sticky.
