## Classification Trees

* Very similar to **regression trees** except it is used to predict a **qualitative response** rather than a **quantitative** one
--

* We predict that each observation belongs to the **most commonly occuring class** of the training observations in a given region

---

## Fitting classification trees

* We use **recursive binary splitting** to grow the tree
--

* Instead of RSS, we can use:
--

* **Gini index**:

$$G = \sum_{k=1}^K \hat{p}_{mk}(1-\hat{p}_{mk})$$
--

* This is a measure of total variance across the $K$ classes. If all of the $\hat{p}_{mk}$ values are close to zero or one, this will be small
--

* The Gini index is a measure of node **purity** small values indicate that node contains predominantly observations from a single class
--

* In `R`, this can be estimated using the `gain_capture()` function.

## Classification tree - Heart Disease Example

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
heart <- read_csv("data/heart.csv")
heart$HD <- as.factor(heart$AHD)
```

* Classifying whether 303 patients have heart disease based on 13 predictors (`Age`, `Sex`, `Chol`, etc)

---

## 1. Split the data into a cross-validation set

```{r}
heart_cv <- vfold_cv(heart, v = 5)
```

--

.question[
How many folds do I have?
]
---

## 2. Create a model specification that tunes based on complexity, $\alpha$

```{r}
tree_spec <- decision_tree(
  cost_complexity = tune(), 
  tree_depth = 10,
  mode = "classification") %>% #<<
  set_engine("rpart")
```

---

## 3. Fit the model on the cross validation set

.small[ 
```{r, cache = TRUE}
grid <- expand_grid(cost_complexity = seq(0.01, 0.05, by = 0.01))
model <- tune_grid(tree_spec,
                   HD ~ Age + Sex + ChestPain + RestBP + Chol + Fbs + 
                     RestECG + MaxHR + ExAng + Oldpeak + Slope + Ca,
                   grid = grid,
                   resamples = heart_cv,
                   metrics = metric_set(gain_capture, accuracy)) #<<
```
]

--

.question[
What $\alpha$s am I trying?
]

---

## 5. Choose $\alpha$ that minimizes the Gini Index


```{r}
best <- model %>%
  select_best(metric = "gain_capture") %>%
  pull()
```

---

## 6. Fit the final model

```{r}
final_spec <- decision_tree(
  cost_complexity = best, 
  tree_depth = 10,
  mode = "classification") %>% 
  set_engine("rpart")

final_model <- fit(final_spec,
    HD ~ Age + Sex + ChestPain + RestBP + Chol + Fbs + 
      RestECG + MaxHR + ExAng + Oldpeak + Slope + Ca + Thal,
    data = heart)
```

---

## 7. Examine how the final model does on the full sample

```{r}
final_model %>%
  predict(new_data = heart) %>%
  bind_cols(heart) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = HD, estimate = .pred_class) %>%
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```

## Decision trees

.pull-left[

### Pros

* simple
* easy to interpret
]

--

.pull-right[

### Cons

* not often competitive in terms of predictive accuracy
* Next class we will discuss how to combine _multiple_ trees to improve accuracy
