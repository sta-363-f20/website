### Class

This class is meant to be _hands on_. You will be learning the theory behind cutting edge statistical and machine learning techniques, as well as how to implement them in R. Therefore, you are responsible for reading pertinent material prior to each class.

### Diversity & Inclusiveness

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.) To help accomplish this:

- If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Wake Forest records, please let me know!
- If any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that we can make arrangements for you.
- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource. 
- I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

### Disability Policy

Students with disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in the class are encouraged to contact Learning Assistance Center & Disability Services at 336-758-5929 or [lacds@wfu.edu](mailto:lacds@wfu.edu) as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. 

### How to get help

#### Discussion:

All course discussion will be via Canvas [Discussions](https://wakeforest.instructure.com/courses/18497/discussion_topics).

Guidelines for posting questions:

* First search existing posts (open or closed) for answers. If the question has already been answered, you're done! If there is an open post, feel free to contribute to it.
* Give your issue an informative title.
    * Good: "Error: could not find function "ggplot"
    * Bad: "R giving errors", "help me!", "aaaarrrrrgh!" Note that you can edit an issue’s title after it's been posted.
* Hit "Save and Publish" when you're ready to post.
 
####  Math & Stats Center:

* Make an appointment: [https://mathandstatscenter.wfu.edu/](https://mathandstatscenter.wfu.edu/)

### Honor code

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. For other information on these matters, please consult the [Code of Conduct](https://studentconduct.wfu.edu/undergraduate-student-handbook/). For Academic issues please see the [College Judicial System](https://studentconduct.wfu.edu/the-judicial-council/).

#### Sharing code & responses

* There are many online resources for sharing code (for example, StackOverflow) - you **may** use these resources but **must explicitly cite** where you have obtained code (both code you used directly and "paraphrased" code / code used as inspiration). Any reused code that is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.
* Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course!

### Course components

#### Reflections

You will have weekly reflections - these will be completed on Canvas. They will open each Thursday and be due the following Tuesday at 5pm ET.

#### Application exercises

These will start in class and should to finished by the following day at 5pm ET. 

#### Labs

The objective of the labs is to give you hands on experience with data analysis using modern statistical software. Labs will be completed in two parts. **Part 1** you will complete **on your own** by the following class day at 5pm ET (i.e. if the lab is assigned on Thursday, it will be due at 5pm ET on the following Tuesday). If you copy someone else's work, both parties will receive a grade of 0.  Part 1 will count towards 70% of your Lab grade. Then **Part 2** will open - this the same lab to be completed **collaboratively**. This will be one document that the whole class will collaborate on to generate a "collaborative key" for the assignment. At the bottom of the document you will be responsible for writing what your specific contribution to this document was. Contributions can include things such as "Provided solution for Question 2", "Offered feedback for Question 4", "Provided code for Question 1", "Edited solutions for grammar", etc. Part 2 will count towards 30% of your Lab grade.

The lab with the lowest score for each student will be dropped.

#### Assessments

We will periodically have assessments.  These assessments cannot be made up. It is expected that you may miss a one due to missing class a time or two; to account for this, two assessments for each student will be dropped.

### Grading

Your final grade will be comprised of the following:

{.table .table-condensed .table-striped .text-left}
 <span></span>        | <span></span>
----------------------|----------------
Participation         | 5%
Reflections           | 5%
Application exercises | 20%
Assessments           | 30%
Labs                  | 40%


Grades conversion: 

{.table .table-condensed .table-striped .text-left}

### Late / missed work

- Late work policy for labs:
    - late, but within 24 hours of due date/time: -50%
    - any later: no credit
    
- No make-up assessments will be given.

- All regrade requests must be discussed with the professor within one week of receiving your grade. There will be no grade changes after the final class.
